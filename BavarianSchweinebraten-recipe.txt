DIRECTIONS
wash and pat dry roast.
mix all dry ingredients together and rub onto roast.
spread a liberal amount of mustard onto roast.
heat oil in a heavy roasting pan (enameled cast iron works well) on top of stove and brown carrots and leeks.
push vegetables aside and brown roast from all sides in the very very hot roasting pan.
ad onions INCLUDING the brown skins (this is VERY IMPORTANT since it will give your gravy an good color).
ad broth and transfer everything to the oven.
roast covered for 1 1/2 hours at 350°F.
uncover, stir onions and veggies.
turn roast over and roast uncovered for 1 hour (if liquid evaporates a lot, add some more occasionally.
once roasting time has finished transfer meat to a plate to rest.
take a basting brush, dip into the hot liquid and scrub all the sides of the roasting pan (and the lid if necessary). All the brown stains on the walls of your pan will ad flavor and color to your sauce!
strain all the liquid through a fine meshed strainer (stainless steel will work better then the plastic ones). Press solids vigorously with a spoon to press as much liquid (as well all solids that can get pressed through) through the strainer into a sauce pan and reduce slightly on high heat.
Slice roast into 1/2 thick slices and pour gravy liberally over everthing.
Best served with potato dumplings and sauerkraut.
